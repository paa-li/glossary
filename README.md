## What

[entry.csv](https://github.com/paa-li/glossary/blob/main/entry.csv) is the CSV file that behaves as a database for the [glossary](https://paa.li/glossary/) page of Paa.Li.

We welcome any feedback. 

## Rules

1. All feedback must be factually correct supported by appropriate sources.

2. Rows must be listed in the **alphabetical order of the Pāḷi language written in ISO 15919** based on the Pāḷi word entries (first column.) The alphabet order of Pāḷi is as follows:
```
a ā i ī u ū e o
ṁ
k kh g gh ṅ
c ch j jh ñ
ṭ ṭh ḍ ḍh ṇ
t th d dh n
p ph b bh m
y r l ḷ v s h
```

3. Synonyms of Pāḷi words must be listed as a separate entry.

4. If there is no known or related Sanskrit equivalent of the Pāḷi word, it must be left as blank. If the Sanskrit equivalent is identical to the Pāḷi word, it must be marked with an equal sign `=`.

5. Varieties of English definitions within a similar context must be separated with a semicolon and a space `; `. English definitions with a different meaning or context must be divided with a comma and a space. `. `.

6. A Chinese term must not be simple a translation of the Pāḷi word into modern Mandarin; it must be a **Buddhist term** formally and globally recognized in Mahayana Buddhism. If there is no formally recognized equivalent, it must be left empty.
